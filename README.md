# Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the demand for bike rentals in Seoul, South Korea, with the objective of optimizing bike availability and enhancing urban mobility infrastructure. It utilizes a dataset containing weather information and historical bike rental counts. The goal is to create accurate models that can predict bike rental demand, helping to improve bike-sharing services in the city.

## Project Objectives

- Enhance Bike Rental Availability: Ensure a stable supply of rental bikes to reduce waiting times and improve the convenience of bike rentals.
- Predictive Modeling: Develop and evaluate regression models that can accurately forecast the number of bikes needed at different times and under varying weather conditions.
- Insights from Data: Uncover patterns and insights within the dataset to better understand the factors influencing bike rental demand.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Exploration and Understanding**: Analyze the dataset, examining weather-related features, time-of-day trends, and seasonal variations in bike rentals.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and prepare the dataset for modeling.

3. **Data Visualization**: Create informative visualizations to reveal patterns and insights in bike rental demand.

4. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Apply regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost) to predict bike rental counts. Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.

5. **Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of different features in predicting bike demand to gain insights into predictive variables.

## Findings and Insights

- The project aims to contribute to Seoul's goal of providing efficient and accessible bike rental services, ultimately enhancing urban mobility in the city.
- Key insights and model performance metrics will be summarized to provide a clear understanding of the project's outcomes.
